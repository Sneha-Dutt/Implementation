# Demo-CorrectedCode


The provided C code simulates reading, processing, and displaying sensor data.

Constants and Includes:

Includes standard libraries: stdio.h, stdint.h, and stdlib.h.
Defines BUFFER_SIZE as 20, representing the number of sensor data points.
Functions:

read_sensor_data(uint16_t *data): Fills an array with 20 random values (0â€“1023) simulating sensor readings.
calculate_average(uint16_t *data, int size): Calculates the average of the sensor data using integer division.
print_data(uint16_t *data, int size): Prints each sensor data point with its index.
process_data(uint16_t *data):
Calculates average sensor value.
Displays the average.
Prints a warning if the average exceeds 512, indicating a potential issue; otherwise, it indicates the data is within a safe range.
Main Function:

Dynamically allocates memory for the sensor data array.
Checks for successful memory allocation, exiting if it fails.
Calls functions to read, process, and print the sensor data.
Frees the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
